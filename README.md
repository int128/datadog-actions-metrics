# datadog-actions-metrics [![ts](https://github.com/int128/datadog-actions-metrics/actions/workflows/ts.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/int128/datadog-actions-metrics/actions/workflows/ts.yaml) [![e2e](https://github.com/int128/datadog-actions-metrics/actions/workflows/e2e.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/int128/datadog-actions-metrics/actions/workflows/e2e.yaml)

This is an action to send metrics of GitHub Actions to Datadog on an event.
It is inspired from [yuya-takeyama/github-actions-metrics-to-datadog-action](https://github.com/yuya-takeyama/github-actions-metrics-to-datadog-action).


## Purpose

### Improve the reliability and experience of CI/CD pipeline

To collect the metrics when a workflow is completed:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows:
      - '**'
    types:
      - completed

jobs:
  send:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 10
    steps:
      - uses: int128/datadog-actions-metrics@v1
        with:
          # create an API key in https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/api-app-keys/
          datadog-api-key: ${{ secrets.DATADOG_API_KEY }}
```

Here is an example of screenshot in Datadog.

For developer experience, you can analyze the following metrics:

- Time to test an application
- Time to deploy an application

For reliability, you can monitor the following metrics:

- Success rate of the main branch
- Rate limit of built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`


### Improve the reliability and experience of self-hosted runners

For the self-hosted runners, you can monitor the following metrics for reliability and experience:

- Count of the [lost communication with the server](https://github.com/actions-runner-controller/actions-runner-controller/issues/466) errors
- Queued time of job (time to pick a job by a runner)


### Improve your team development process

You can analyze your development activity such as number of merged pull requests.
It helps the continuous process improvement of your team.

To collect the metrics when a pull request is opened or closed:

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - opened
      - closed

jobs:
  send:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 10
    steps:
      - uses: int128/datadog-actions-metrics@v1
        with:
          # create an API key in https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/api-app-keys/
          datadog-api-key: ${{ secrets.DATADOG_API_KEY }}
```

### Enable job or step metrics

Note that this action calls GitHub GraphQL API to get jobs and steps of a workflow run.
It may cause the rate exceeding error if too many workflows are run.
It may also increase the cost of custom metrics in Datadog.

To send the metrics of jobs and steps:

```yaml
      - uses: int128/datadog-actions-metrics@v1
        with:
          datadog-api-key: ${{ secrets.DATADOG_API_KEY }}
          collect-job-metrics: true
          collect-step-metrics: true
```

To send the metrics of jobs and steps on the default branch only:

```yaml
      - uses: int128/datadog-actions-metrics@v1
        with:
          datadog-api-key: ${{ secrets.DATADOG_API_KEY }}
          collect-job-metrics: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.head_branch == github.event.repository.default_branch }}
          collect-step-metrics: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.head_branch == github.event.repository.default_branch }}
```

## Metrics for schedule event

### Workflow run

This action sends the following metrics:

It has the following tags:

- `repository_name`

It is useful for monitoring self-hosted runners.


## Metrics for all supported events

### Rate limit

This action always sends the following metrics of [the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` rate limit](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#rate-limiting).

- `github.actions.api_rate_limit.remaining`
- `github.actions.api_rate_limit.limit`

It has the following tags:

- `repository_owner`
- `repository_name`
- `resource` = `core`, `search` and `graphql`

This does not affect the rate limit of GitHub API because it just calls [`/rate_limit` endpoint](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/rate-limit).


## Specification

You can set the following inputs:

Name | Default | Description
-----|---------|------------
`github-token` | `github.token` | GitHub token to get jobs and steps if needed
`github-token-rate-limit-metrics` | `github.token` | GitHub token for rate limit metrics
`datadog-api-key` | - | Datadog API key. If not set, this action does not send metrics actually
`datadog-site` | - | Datadog Server name such as `datadoghq.eu`, `ddog-gov.com`, `us3.datadoghq.com`
`send-pull-request-labels` | `false` | Send pull request labels as Datadog tags
`collect-job-metrics` | `false` | Collect job metrics
`collect-step-metrics` | `false` | Collect step metrics

### Breaking changes

`collect-step-metrics` is explicitly required to send the step metrics.

`collect-job-metrics-for-only-default-branch` is no longer supported.
Use `collect-job-metrics` instead.
